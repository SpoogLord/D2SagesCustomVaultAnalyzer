This is a savable DIM search for removing the pits from the plums, the dust from the gold, the God Tier (or damn near) armor from the trash, mid, good, and great armor.

This filter assumes you use the "infuse" tag to mark infusion fodder, and that you know not to delete pinnacle armor. This filter isn't as nice as its forefather.

The Custom Stat Edition is tuned to have 4 stats set as custom stats, id suggest replacing 55 with 48 or so for 3 stat builds
