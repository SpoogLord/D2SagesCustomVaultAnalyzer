This is a repo containing all my custom made D2 tools



The [Recommended Items Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpoogLord/Sages-D2-Repository/main/Sage's%20Custom%20Recomended%20Items%20Search.txt) is made to be used in DIM's vendors tab to find any items that match your wishlist

The [Vault Analizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpoogLord/Sages-D2-Repository/main/Sage's%20Custom%20Vault%20Analyzer) is made to be used in your inventory page on DIM, it will highlight any armor I wouldnt keep. it ignores exotics because typically exotics are used for their perks, not their stats, if you tag something as "infuse" it will assume that item is infusion fodder, if you tag something as "favorite" or "keep" it will not highlight that item

The [Vault Analyzer (Custom Stat Edition)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpoogLord/Sages-D2-Repository/main/Sage's%20Custom%20Vault%20Analyzer%20(Custom%20Stat%20Edition)) is the Vault Analyzer but adds a condition to keep items with a "Custom Total" of 55 or higher. This number was chosen based on my 4 stat custom total, if you use a 3 stat custom total you may want to tweak this number

[Sages God Rolls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpoogLord/Sages-D2-Repository/main/Sage's%20God%20Rolls.txt) is a custom wishlist that is still in development, i plan to cover most modern weapons but mostly just for my personal rolls. Like im not too interested in things that require special upkeep like cascade point, but if i think it goes really well in a certain circumstance i will add it (Ex: Edge Transit)
